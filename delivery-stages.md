# Delivery Stages

Subsequent Delivery Stages come after Controlling a Stage (CS). CS counsels the project manager on how to approve work on project resources, monitor and report progress, manage risks and issues, and remedy deviations from the plan. In order to take the project ahead stage by stage, the project board allocated day-to-day team activities and decisions. The CS process assigns duties to team members to ensure that they remain focused on delivering the goods and meeting the project plan's objectives. The team members are guided by the Managing Product (MP) Delivery technique. Design specifications are satisfied when components are delivered; the business case is validated for mission relevance, and the stage plan is completed. The SB procedure is performed once more to report and complete the stage. To continue solution fulfillment, the CS and MP procedures are repeated in successive Delivery Stages in the project plan.
