# Introduction

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.&#x20;

It is used to structure the content of a website, and provides a way to define the layout, headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements that make up a webpage.&#x20;

HTML is a markup language, which means that it uses a system of tags to indicate how the content should be displayed on a webpage.&#x20;

These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. ) and come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. and ). The content between the tags is interpreted according to the specific tag used. HTML is a client-side language, meaning that the code is executed by the web browser on the user's device, not on the server.&#x20;

It's widely used along with CSS and JavaScript to create modern web pages.
