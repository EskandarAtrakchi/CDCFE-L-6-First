# Risk appetite

Is the level of risk that I’m ready to take in order to keep track of my goals that I believe are worthwhile. The highest amount of residual risk that I’m willing to accept is referred to as risk appetite.

After) we see the risk has been lowered, table one shows that the risk was high, after taking the risks' backup plans and the steps to address them we see that in table two the risk has been lowered. However, after reducing the risk possibility, and impact after determining proactive mitigation actions by addressing risk sources or creating a backup plan, existing risk exposure in the event that specific permitted actions are later carried out.
