# Pre-Mitigation

Here, Iâ€™m evaluating a risk's probability and impact after analyzing it and creating a small description of it, taking into account the project's goals and present strategy. The next step supposes to determine proactive mitigation measures by addressing risk sources or developing a backup plan, lower the risk likelihood and/or impact. So, here I would say current risk exposure is based on the supposition that the risk is accepted without any particular responses.
