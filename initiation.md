# Initiation

The Initiation Stage continues the DP process by providing regular monitoring and ad hoc project guidance. Following clearance to proceed with the investment, the Initiating a Project (IP) process lays the groundwork for project success by identifying project objectives and commercial advantages. IP also directs the team to customize project plans and to exercise governance over project operations. PRINCE2 supports plans for controlling communications, scope, cost, schedule, risks, problems, quality, and product configuration management. Techniques from other widely used project management guides readily connect with PRINCE2 procedures to monitor and control investment.

Following the completion of the Initiation Stage, the Managing a Stage Boundary (SB) procedure requires the project manager to plan the next stage of the project. The project manager conducts a business case review, updates the project plan, and reports to the project board on the status of the investment.

**Documents** for the initiation stage, project Managers may begin the process at the Pre-Project phase and subsequently add further cost information, which Executives will review.

The project description, document details, scope and exclusions, purpose, project objectives, interfaces, project deliverables, and assumptions are all included in PID PRINCE2.

We have the following documents in terms of Project Initiation Documentation (PID).

\-          Documents relating to communication, change control, etc.

\-          There are three components of the Project Plan the Product Breakdown Structure, the Project Descriptions, and the Flow Diagram.

\-          The Project Controls.

\-          Project Management Team Roles.

\-          Project Approach.

This is the final step of the Stage Boundary process, and it is where the next stage will be planned.
