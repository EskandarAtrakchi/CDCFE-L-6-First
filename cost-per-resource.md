We can see the difference in this table by evaluating the effectiveness of a project, listing the team members and their roles is a metric! it is true that the table above is about building a website but what I find interesting is that this metric can be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different projects also, simply by dividing the project’s total cost by the number of resources used.

It’s nice to mention that this is bottom-up since we are building from the ground up, trying to get as many details as possible, and down below image explains why this is bottom-up.
