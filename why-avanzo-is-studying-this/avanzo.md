With well-chosen assets, investors may profit from consistent cash flow and favorable returns. According to some, one of the most valuable assets in the present and the future is real estate, because they consider it to have cash flow. It may be the perfect "store of value" if chosen well, offering investors the assurance that their money is safe and linked to a resource that has true worth and generates returns on a monthly or annual basis (your value is always stored and generates income).

Real estate investors' primary sources of income include appreciation, rental income, and profits from enterprises reliant on real estate. Real estate has a tendency to appreciate in value over time, so if you make a smart investment, you can profit when it comes time to sell.&#x20;

As we have seen in this research that rents also have a propensity to rise over time, which might improve cash flow. \
