Smart contracts make guarantee that signatures are gathered in the correct sequence necessary to fulfill the agreement since the blockchain maintains a permanent ordered record of each transaction.&#x20;

Summary. The problem of trust in the digital age is resolved by smart contracts. These are decentralized digital superior agreements that have the potential to transform whole sectors into ones that are more trustworthy, secure, and fair and that is the reason Avanzo is using smart contracts.

#### Why does Avanzo use Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

Community-run organizations without a centralized administrative structure are known as decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs. Smart contracts are used by Avanzo to give its investors total ownership of decision-making, create the rules, and carry out the selected course of action in a completely autonomous and transparent manner. Avanzo thinks about DAOs because this is an excellent illustration of how everything will be recorded in the blockchain.

#### Why does Avanzo use NFTs?

An NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital object. An NFT value is given by that rarity. If you invested in a part of property, the blockchain records every transaction, together with your wallet address and signature, making it impossible for anybody to alter the evidence that you are the owner of that property.&#x20;

One of the Trinity students (Rutvi Parekh), thinks it is better to generate contracts of real estate as NFTs, because it's going to be more transparent, more secure, and gives more flexibility to trade.
