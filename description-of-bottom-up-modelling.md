# Description of Bottom Up Modelling

(Puscasu, 2022)

Bottom-up built from the ground up, it usually gets into details, we use this model when resources shouldn’t be constrained to fit the estimated cost. This model (which requires high level of detail) gets into customer, product, and even geography details, and because of that, it’s more complex.

Pros: This model helps to spot issues, uncover things not otherwise seen, and even opportunities.

Cons: It can take much longer and requires effort, and several iterations might be required if the top management doesn’t agree with the numbers!
