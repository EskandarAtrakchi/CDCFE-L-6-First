# Some Statistics

Whatever your political views on immigration, the truth remains that migrants and refugees require a place to live. The bulk of them has no choice but to rent since they cannot afford to purchase. Over 6.4 million Ukrainian refugees are expected to have fled the nation since Russia's invasion in February, with Poland alone taking in over 1.2 million.

In this case, the demand for rent from migrants and refugees provides real estate investors with the cash flow they need to continue purchasing properties despite rising interest rates, as basic economics states if demand for something increases while its supply remains the same, then its price increases.

The official population figures do not account for all of the illegal migration that has occurred in many countries, as well as all of the refugees who have fled territories such as Ukraine.&#x20;

In-migration affects real estate significantly, boosting demand for both residential and commercial space. When supply fails to meet demand, prices usually rise. We used Oxford Economics data to calculate which cities are expected to experience the largest net migration as a percentage of their population over the next five years.

The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is estimated to be between 10 and 12 million, but given that US border agents have encountered over 4,000,000 illegal aliens since January 2021, 800,000 of whom have not been imprisoned, this figure is very definitely substantially higher.

While cities in Europe are expected to have lower proportionate net migration than cities in Asia or even North America, several smaller European cities are expected to have substantial migration inflows relative to their present population.

Zurich and Geneva are predicted to have the highest proportionate inflows, although smaller towns with strong technological scenes, such as Stockholm, Munich, and Vienna, are also expected to have quite high levels of net migration.

Cities in Europe with lively economies and strong domestic economies have historically drawn both local and foreign migrants. Notably, economic systems that have allowed individuals to roam relatively freely have made many Northern and Western European towns appealing to workers seeking better employment possibilities from the East and South.

"Because countries like Switzerland and Sweden have robust economies, their cities attract both smart people searching for high-value employment and less-skilled employees looking for greater earnings," says Eri Mitsostergiou, Savills' Director of European Research.

Wages aren't the main motivator. "These countries rate favorably in terms of quality of life," adds Mitsostergiou. "This is linked to the relatively generous welfare systems, which include strong pensions and healthcare."

Keep in mind that the study is limited to cities having a GDP of more than $50 billion. Migration is defined as the difference between the number of individuals moving into and leaving a certain location.
