# Top-Down

A small group of individuals (typically under the oversight of top-level management) assess the company, industry, and environment/economy.

* **Broad-based assumptions** for things like market growth, industry growth, inflation, etc.
* **Level of details** usually don’t get into customer-level, product-level, cost build-up, etc.
* **Complexity/Difficulty** can vary on level of detail, but typically simpler, easier, and faster than a bottoms-up

**Pros:** it’s faster and easier as it allows the company to focus on the strategy and not get bogged down in details, leadership owns the forecast so should have alignment with stakeholders/shareholders. Plus, doesn’t need as many people to do the forecast.

**Cons:** typically, less accurate, and just because it is done at a higher level of detail that causes two more Cons: it makes it difficult to explain the variations from the forecast and misses the opportunity to spot an issue or opportunities.

**When to use?**

* Time-limited availability.
* In the out-years of long-term forecast.
* When things are too volatile.
* Resource constrained.
