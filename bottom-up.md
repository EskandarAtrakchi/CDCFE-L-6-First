# Bottom-up

Employees and management across the business assess details of the business (products, customers, new products, costs, etc.) to inform the future.

* **Assumptions:** inputs from the sales team, customers, industry intelligence, procurement, and more!
* **Details:** Typically, gets into granular details (customer, product, geography, etc.)
* **Complexity/Difficulty** is more because of the level of detail. Required high-level modeling skills.

**Pros:** by aligning the goals of everyone in the business, bottom-up forecast has many elements that become the guide for operating the business (How many people to hire, procurement plan, production plan) and because of the level of the details, it enables the business to:

1. spot issues, uncover things not otherwise seen, and opportunities
2. Analysis of actual performance VS. forecast

**Cons:** requires alignment and coordination and this more of the reasons that it take much longer and requires effort, beside all that, we might have several iterations if top management doesnâ€™t agree with the numbers!

**When to use?**

* Detailed one-year annual operating plans.
* If the business is complicated with so many pieces coming together.
* In existing system in place to do each year.
* If we must be able to explain variances from the forecast.
