# Intro

Financial planning to build budgets is critical for my vehicles database project. I may use them to estimate the expenses and revenues of a possible new project by comparing my project with others in the same industry (If itâ€™s possible). I will explore two models that describe top-down and bottom-up planning for my project. Discuss how these two models may aid my project and which model I should adopt.
