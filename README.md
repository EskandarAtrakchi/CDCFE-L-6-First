# Introduction

PRINCE2 stands for PRojects IN Controlled Environments and is meant to guide, manage, and complete project according to schedule. PRINCE2 is maintained by [AXELOS](https://www.axelos.com/) and is built upon 7 Principles, 7 themes, and 7 processes.

PRINCE2 is a very flexible method that guides us through the essentials for managing successful project.

The project team undertakes numerous tasks to meet goals of the business case across seven distinct processes. Following a stage-gate lifecycle form, PRINCE2's seven processes integrate with one another. This establishes a rhythm for project management activities, guiding outcomes toward achievement of predetermined goals.&#x20;
