# Introduction

This assignment involves conducting research on evaluation and monitoring in Agile and waterfall environments.

A written manual that aids program administrators in keeping track of and assessing the outcomes of interventions is known as a monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) plan. It is a living document that requires frequent updating and reference. The specifics of the M\&E plan for each program will vary, but they should all adhere to the same guiding principles and include the same crucial elements.
