# Post-Mitigation

Here, I’m estimating the risk on the bases of the identified mitigation actions.

Basically, I’m getting the contexts of relevant facts then the sources of the uncertainty, and then the impacts to reduce them. However, no actions are authorized yet in post-mitigation. So, here I would say existing risk exposure under the assumption that particular authorized actions will be implemented later on.
