# A discussion of the development of hypertext mark-up language (HTML)

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It was first developed in the late 1980s by Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). Berners-Lee had the idea to create a system for sharing scientific documents, and he developed the first version of HTML as a way to structure and format the content of these documents.

Over time, HTML evolved and new versions were released. HTML 2.0, released in 1995, added support for tables and forms. HTML 3.2, released in 1997, introduced new tags for layout, such as \<div> and \<span>. With the release of HTML 4.0 in 1998, support for multimedia, such as images and audio, was added.

The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which was released in 2014. HTML5 includes new tags for multimedia, such as \<video> and \<audio>, as well as new tags for semantic markup, such as \<article> and \<header>. Additionally, HTML5 introduced new APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to create interactive web pages without relying on third-party plug-ins such as Flash.
