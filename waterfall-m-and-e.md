# Waterfall (M\&E)

It’s simple to monitor progress by laying out a waterfall-project in a Gantt-chart. The timeline functions as a progress bar, making it always clear what stage a project is in.

According to research, flow-chart or Gantt-chart is the best way to characterize waterfall. How the prior phase "falls" into the following phase is characterized in a Gantt-chart.

The project-manager used the five sets of stages—requirements definition, design, execution, verification, and deployment—to create a clear work structure also following the Prince 2 principles.

| **Advantages**                                              | **Dis-Advantages**                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Tasks completion is good to keep the team members on track. | Changing is difficult.                          |
| Quality oriented                                            | Project might fail if doesn’t meet the criteria |
| Saves resources                                             | lot of documentations                           |
