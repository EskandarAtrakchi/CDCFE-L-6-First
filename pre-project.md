# Pre â€“ Project

During the Pre-project Stage, the investment's business objectives are identified by carrying out the actions in the Starting up a Project (SU) process. The business justifications for the investment are developed, the scope is specified, and alternatives are assessed. The business case is created through the SU process, preparing the project team to acquire approval to proceed with the investment.

The project is assessed and authorized by an executive review board before being placed in the IT portfolio as part of the Directing a Project (DP) procedure. DP procedures manage the business case throughout the project lifecycle by providing senior-level monitoring of the investment's development.

**Documents** for this stage as the first templates to be discussed are those for PRINCE2 documents that were generated during the preproposal phase.:

&#x20;

\-          **Project Mandate CPC Layer**

You'll notice that the CPC establishes a Project Mandate before the project begins and that it originates from outside the project before the "Starting up a Project Process" step.

\-          **Outline Business Case Project Board Layer**

This document should be written by one of the Project Board members. More specifically, the Executive is in charge of this document.

\-          **Project Manager Layer All the other documents from the SU process**

that all other documents are the responsibility of project managers, we will find the following documents here

* Project Product Description (PPD)
* Approach
* Project Management Team document (PMT)
* Project Brief (contains all of the above)
* Initiation Stage Plan
* Lessons Log
* Daily Log

During the Pre-Project Stage, we will only produce these documents. The next is the initial phase in the process, which will be discussed next.
