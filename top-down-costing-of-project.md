# Top down costing of Project

&#x20;It’s good to estimate the time, total price, and which activities can be incorporated into my vehicle database-project, but first, I need to know which model is the best for my vehicle-database.

| **Condition**             | **Top Down** | **Bottom Up** |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Strategic decision-making | Yes          |               |
| Cost & time important     |              | Yes           |
| High uncertainty          | Yes          |               |
| Internal, small project   | Yes          |               |
| Fixed-price contract      |              | Yes           |
| Customer wants details    |              | Yes           |
| Unstable scope            | Yes          |               |

&#x20;

I’ll work with the Bottom-Up model for the reasons mentioned in the table above. However, let’s talk a little about Top-Down, the estimates are often generated by someone who uses expertise and/or knowledge to calculate the project time and final cost. These estimations are occasionally produced by senior executives who have little awareness of the processes involved in completing the project.
