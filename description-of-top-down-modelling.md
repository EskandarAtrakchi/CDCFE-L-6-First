# Description of Top Down Modelling

Begin with the big picture and then split it down into smaller pieces, that is basically what Top-Down is. We use this model when things are too volatile, this model usually doesn’t get to customer-level or even product-level and for the complexity; it’s usually simpler than the Bottoms-Up.

Pros: it’s faster and easier; it helps to focus on strategy rather than specifics, Furthermore, the prediction doesn’t require as many personnel.

Cons: less accurate, and just because it's done with a less degree of detail, it loses the opportunity to identify problems or opportunities.
