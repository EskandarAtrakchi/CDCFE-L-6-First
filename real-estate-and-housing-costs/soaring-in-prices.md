# Soaring in Prices

It is crucial to understand that institutional investors have only a small effect on the US real estate market. Although significant corporations exist for flats and other multi-family housing units, single-family homes have not received the same level of investment. The real estate market has become an extremely profitable place to put your money, luring yield-seeking investors. And the main reason it has become so profitable is the global scarcity of nearly 4 million residences generated by local governments and people who want to restrict the construction of new homes.

Research by John Burns Real Estate Consulting is frequently cited in publications asserting that institutional investors are driving up the cost of single-family homes and are in a price war with typical purchasers. One even stated, according to John Burns's research, that investors are "a key cause" of the hot market. In reality, the research makes it clear that the US "does not currently have an investor-induced housing price bubble."

According to the research, the proportion of all house sales that are the result of investor acquisitions has actually decreased over the last 12 months. Furthermore, even at its height in 2013 (when normal sales had peaked as a result of the recession), it still represented just 29% of overall sales. The company believes that around 20% of house transactions last year were to investors.

Importantly, that figure includes everyone who isn't simply purchasing a property for their own permanent residence — it includes folks buying second homes or holiday rentals, mom-and-pop landlords, and tiny investors flipping houses for a profit. According to Marketplace, it might also include Buyers or investors who "make rapid cash offers on properties and quickly sell them." businesses like BlackRock might be included. John Burns examined residences where the property tax records went to a different location than the home itself, and Rick Palacios, the firm's director of research, stated that it's impossible to know from this data what portion of these transactions originates directly from institutional investors.

In response to a viral Twitter thread accusing BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, of purchasing "every single family house they can find... and outbidding normal home buyers," even J.D. Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy who is running for the US Senate in Ohio, claimed that "The Left" was ignoring the issue because of BlackRock's corporate diversity initiatives.

Some people are outraged by suggestions that institutional investors—often private equity firms—are pushing up real estate prices and driving up demand for homes, according to Vox, an American news and commentary website owned by Vox Media. Yield-seeking investors are reportedly purchasing single-family homes and "competing with average Americans," according to a recent Wall Street Journal piece. Marketplace confirmed this, noting that a single bidder had been outbid by all-cash bids six times. According to Inman, consumers are "increasingly competing against institutional investors." The Real Deal continues, "this enormous institutional investor buying frenzy is actually the fundamental cause for the increased prices."

According to Vox, a news and opinion website in the United States owned by Vox Media, some consumers are offended by claims that institutional investors—often private equity firms—are driving up real estate prices and increasing demand for houses. Investors seeking return are reportedly purchasing single-family homes and "competing with normal Americans," according to a recent Wall Street Journal article. The identical incident was mentioned on Marketplace, which also mentioned that one bidder had been outbid by all-cash bids six times. Consumers are "increasingly competing against institutional investors," according to Inman. The Real Deal claims that the main cause of the price increases is "a major purchasing frenzy from institutional investors."

According to Redfin statistics, buyer demand for second homes grew by roughly 178 percent between April 2020 and April 2021. (The demand trough was in April 2020, but as the graph below shows, second home demand has well beyond pre-recession demand.) It's probable that a significant portion of these investment acquisitions are made by second-home purchasers.
