From the table above we can see that in a financial model, the cost per task is the average cost of completing a task. This cost can be used to compare different tasks or different ways of completing a task. The cost per task can be affected by the number of people working on the task, the amount of time it takes to complete the task, and I would like to add the equipments been used, and other factors that might be predictable or unpredictable justifying the 20% contingency.
