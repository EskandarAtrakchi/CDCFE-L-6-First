# Examine different HTML versions and backward compatibility issues.

Each new version of HTML brings new features, but also may include some changes that can break older websites. Backward compatibility issues arise when a website that was built using an older version of HTML does not work as expected when viewed using a newer web browser or device. These issues can range from minor formatting errors to complete failure of the website.

To mitigate these issues, web developers can use techniques such as feature detection and polyfilling to ensure that their websites continue to work across different browsers and devices.
