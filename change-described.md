# Change Described

As a change manager, itâ€™s my responsibility to be familiar with the project's initial plan, establish the change process, and assemble it with the project owner and other participants to improve understanding of the change which may include the project's scope, objectives, and deadline.

&#x20;

The **Objectives** of my database:

Ensure that the services meet business needs. Ascertain that UserPassWord, a database variable, can update its holding, that modifications are assessed and noted, and that authorized change is managed, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented, and reviewed.

&#x20;

In my database, I should be examining and defining all the various types of data that my database produces and see the possible changes in that UserPassWord variable connection among those data points, which is called data modelling.

Here we can say that customers can change their password and the requirements are the following:

* UserName (PK)&#x20;
* UserPassWord&#x20;
* UserPhoneNumber&#x20;
* UserDOB&#x20;
* UserAddress&#x20;
* UserEriCode
