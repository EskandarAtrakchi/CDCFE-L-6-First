# Risk Averse

Is if Iâ€™m willing to take the risk or not, good to mention that there must be a risk in any project not only mine, however, the more accurate plans, contingency, and evaluation of the severity the more likely that the risk will be understood if the project will be taken or not, and all of this is, of course, cannot be 100% accurate. However, it should be as accurate as possible to accept the risk, in my case, I think I have determined proactive mitigation measures by addressing risk sources, lower the risk likelihood and impact, so my project is a risk taker.
