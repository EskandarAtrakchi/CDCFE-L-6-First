# Conclusion

After research, I find that financial models are mathematical models that explain and forecast financial and economic activity. The cost-estimating process is not easy because it’s extremely difficult to estimate the exact costs, some companies hire more than one candidate to estimate the costs. But to be more accurate we can take it like this; The best way to estimate the cost per task is that for each task is to know our company's average cost per task, and for cost per resource is by divide the total cost of a project or activity by the total number of resources used.

$$
TaskPerUnit = ∑Task's Cost / ∑Tasks
$$

$$
ResourcePerUnit = ∑Project's Cost / ∑Resource
$$

There are, of course, different ways of calculating the cost such as the numbers of the estimated hours (shown in the tables above), but my point is; it’s somehow difficult to exactly estimate the costs, however, it makes perfect sense to use it for financial planning.

I have good understanding of Top-Down because I’m trying to build a project and my project begins with the big picture and work the way down it’s totally the opposite from Bottom-Up.
