# Conclusion

Why change is important? The change is happening everyday not only in projects but in technology also and most of the projects are up because of the technology and as a computer science student I’m totally aware of that.

Through this project, I gained insight into the efficiency and significance of altering the project's life cycle by changing my LLDs by adding a feature to give the customer’s a choice to change their password, it’s a good idea to give the feeling to the customers that each customer controls their own account by letting them change their own password. Although, all the requirements are needed it’s just because changing passwords is considered a sensitive case.

The variable UserPassWord will be updated, the point of that is not to have a lot of unused variables it will create problems in my ERD.
