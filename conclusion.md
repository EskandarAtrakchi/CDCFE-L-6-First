# Conclusion

Why are project monitoring and evaluation crucial? Monitoring and evaluating projects allows us to identify and mitigate issues (previous assignments) that may have an impact on the project's scope, quality, timeline, or budget. we can then use those insights to improve processes for future projects. It offers a means of evaluating the vital connection between on-the-ground implementers, beneficiaries, and decision-makers; it contributes to the preservation and growth of institutional memory; it offers a more solid foundation for obtaining funding and influencing policy.

In other words, monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) assess the degree to which the project is having or has had the desired impact while ensuring that resources are utilized as effectively and efficiently as possible. Monitoring involves regularly tracking the critical components of a program's effectiveness (inputs, activities, results). There are a lot of tools that different companies are using such as task-board and velocity-chart for monitoring Agile projects and Spider-chart, Star-plots, and Radar-charts for evaluation of Agile projects. A waterfall flow-chart or Gantt-chart is used for monitoring projects and a lot of documentation for evaluating projects (which many explain that Waterfall has more documentation than Agile).
