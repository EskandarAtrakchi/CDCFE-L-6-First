# Conclusion

The administration of all sorts of projects is made simple and scalable by the process-based approach to project management. Each process/phase is described together with its essential inputs and outputs, as well as the goals to be met, and the actions to be taken. We see how this can provides foundational knowledge required to succeed, and this can be taken seriously as whether managing a one-day event or constructing a nuclear power station, PRINCE2 is a project management methodology that can be utilized for every project. So, no wonder why PRINCE2 is used all over the world!
